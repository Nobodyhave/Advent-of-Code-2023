# Advent-of-Code-2023

Advent of Code 2023 is over. Leaderboard is set. So here you can find solutions for all the problems.

Solutions are all in Kotlin.

**Disclaimer:** solutions are written in a "contest code style", which means "write fast, read never". 
In some places I tried to work on readability, but don't treat the solutions as examples of a good code. 
Their main goal is to provide a correct answer with minimum time for coding.
