Usual brute force works. We need to find all the rows that should be expanded and then all the columns that should be expanded. Based on it
we can create a new 2D array of the expanded universe. From it we can get the positions of the galaxies and calculate the distances together
 with the resulting distance.

Part 2

Brute force won't work here of course. What we need to do is to calculate the position of the galaxy without creating the new 2D array. In
order to do it we can take the expandable rows and columns indices and sort them. Then when calculating the galaxy's coordinates we check
how many expandable rows and columns were before this galaxy and put this number scaled as the coordinates. The rest is to calculate the
distance. As this approach can be applied to any expansion scale, I reused it in the first problem too.
