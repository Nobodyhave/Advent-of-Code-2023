First part jus requires to neatly organise the data to classes, parse it and do the calculations. Without properly organised data it will
be a mess.

Part 2
---
Second part is mostly based on some shady assumptions. First we need to analyse the input. We can see, that rx node has only one input, and
it's a conjunction node. Which means, that only when the all of its inputs are set to HIGH a low signal will be sent to the rx node. As we
are hitting the button infinite amount of times there definitely will be cycles. What we want is to find when each of the inputs is turned
to high. We can put some logging to the code and print the count of the button presses. For each of the inputs we can see that it turns HIGH
 only once per few thousands of cycles. We make an assumption that the cycles are aligned, so what we need to find is the LCM of their
 length. We calculate it, and it's the correct answer.
