Part 1
---
This part is mostly implementation. Neatly organising all conditions of ray tracing is very useful to reduce the amout of errors. Otherwise,
it's a regular BFS or DFS algorithm. I've chosen the BFS approach. When the light passes the cell it's marked as energized. Also it's added
to the processed cells. This is needed because the light can enter the cell from the different sides and provide the different output. The
condition to stop will be when we exhaust all the possible combinations for all the cells which the light can reach.

Part 2
---
In this part we just apply the procedure from the first part to every edge cell. And as everything was already neatly organised it's just
adding a search for maximum with the help of 2 cycles.
