Part 1
---
In the first part we can do a brute force. Take 2 rows, compare is they are mirroring each other. If yes take adjacent rows etc. Until we
hit the pattern boundaries. If mirror line is not found do the same for columns. If mirror line is found calculate the value for it. Repeat
for all the patterns and sum up.

Part 2
---
For the second part I first just tried to adopt the same brute force solution. In addition, I was changing each and every symbol in the
pattern one by one and running the part one solution on it. But there were some caveats, or maybe I was misinterpreting the text of the task
. I was either getting the old line, or no line or some other problems. Solution became messy, and I decided to try another approach.
Smudging actually allows, or even forces us to allow one error in the mirroring process. So I introduced the parameter for this. For part 1
it's 0, and for part 2 it's 1. Then I changed the logic of scanning the rows and columns from checking is they are mirroring to the error
counting. If the error count was matching the one that we were looking for, then note was reported. And this approach worked perfectly.
