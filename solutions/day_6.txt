Part 1
---
We first need to parse the input to get the list of games. The for each and every game we just to the brute force calculations by increasing
 the holding time, calculating start speed and resulting distance and counting the amount of ways to beat the record.

Part 2
---
Same as part 1, just the input parsing is a bit different, it makes one number instead of a list, so we need to make calculations only for
one game.
