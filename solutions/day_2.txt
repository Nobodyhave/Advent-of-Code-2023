Part 1
---
We split the input to the lines, parse the line to the Game class, containing game id and balls counts for each attempt. Then we check that
in each attempt the amount of the balls used is not larger that the maximum allowed amount of balls. And sum the valid game ids.

Part 2
---
In the second part we just need to fold all the game attempts to find the largerst amount of balls used in any of them.
