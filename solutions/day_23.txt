Part 1
---
Regular backtracking with some conditions how to move.

Part 2
---
Same as part 1 with even less conditions, which actually makes things harder as the problem space increases. It's the longesth
path in a graph problem. The Longest path problem in general is a NP-Complete Problem because there are no found algorithm to solve the
problem in a Hamiltonian graph within polynomial time. So there is no good way to solve it, unless we put some restrictions on the graph. I
was lazy to check it. So my options were brute force or some heuristics running for a long time and printing the next best path length.
Luckily 10 minutes of brute force gave me the correct result.
