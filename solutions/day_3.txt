Part 1
---
We convert the input to the grid where we can address every character with 2 indices. Then we go through the grid. When we hit a digit we
read the whole number and then check if it has a symbol adjacent to it. As a result we summarise all those numbers.

Part 2
---
In the second part we have a map of gears, where key is the combination of row and columns indices, value is the Gear object which holds
adjacent numbers. When we go through the numbers same way as in part 1, we check whether the adjacent symbol is a gear. If yes, we put the
number to the gear object. Then for all valid gears (having 2 numbers adjacent) we calculate the gear ration and the result.
