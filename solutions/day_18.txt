Part 1
---
For the first part I initially reused the approach from the Day 10 - created a polygon from the vertices, found its rectangular boundaries,
 checked whether every point in these boundaries is inside the polygon or not, added the perimeter of the polygon. It worked, but it was
 quite slow.

Part 2
---
In the second part distances became a lot larger, so the approach wouldn't work. After some googling I've found the Shoelace formula for the
 polygon. But it was giving the incorrect results on my polygon. It was happening because the polygon border has a thickness and it has to
 be included in the area too. The initial set of points was giving sometimes the outer coordinates of the border and sometimes the inner
 coordinates. I've tried to create another set of points based on the original one in that way, that I was always using the outer
 coordinates of the border. It worked for part 1, both small and big input. And for part 2 small input. Unfortunately it was giving wrong
 result for the big input. Not sure whether it was an implementation problem of the approach. Some more googling gave me pick's theorem. The
  number of boundary points can be calculated by just adding up all the distances in the instructions, and the area can be figured out by
  applying shoelace formula to the vertices of the polygon without their modification. It will be only inner area. Once we have those two
  pieces of information, Pick's theorem can be used to get the number of interior points, and then adding the number of interior points to
  the number of boundary points gives us the answer.
