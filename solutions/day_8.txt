Part 1

First we parse the data and organise it in a simple map. Then we just follow the instructions until we find the exit node.

Part 2
---
In the second part we can do the same. We just need to analyse not one node, but a set of nodes. Unfortunately this solution takes too long
. By running this solution it's clearly visible that the amount of steps is huge. But we actually have the limited amount of states. For
every node it's possible to be in one of the steps of the instructions, so the amount of the unique states is the product of the amount of
nodes (~800) and amount of instructions (~200). So the total is ~ 160 000. Which means that we are hitting the same states. As the
instructions are cyclic, hitting the same states happens also in a cyclic manner. But cycle lengths are different for the different nodes.
What we need is to find the cycle length for each node ending with "Z". Then we just find the LCM of these cycles lengths and this will be
the answer.
