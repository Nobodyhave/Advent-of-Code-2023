Part 1
---
In the first part we split the lines and then create a Card object from each line. Then using each card we just calculate the result.

Part 2
---
Start is the same as in part 1. We use a queue to go on. When we get a card we just throw the copies to the end of the queue. And continue
polling from the head of the queue. For each polling we increase the count.
