First we need to organise the date from the Almanac. AlmanacEntry and Almanac classes are for this. They have all the info about seeds, maps
 etc. Then we just take each seed from the input and trace it though the maps to find the location with the smallest number. Solution is
 pretty straightforward, but requires careful coding and good data organisation

If we try to do the same approach (single seed tracing) then it would take a lot of time. So the approach would be to use the whole ranges.
What we need is to take some input range, get it through the map and then get the output ranges. There are many tricky moments around with
many conditions, making this approach hard to code. The main trick is to handle multiple ranges and sources. The main idea is to find all
the intersection between the sources ranges and ranges in a map. Only after all the intersections are found we can add the values from the
sources that don't have mapping.
