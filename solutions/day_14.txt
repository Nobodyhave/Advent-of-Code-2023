Part 1

This part is an easy implementation task. We need to make the tilt and calculate the load. Tilting can be done based on the bubble sort
algorithm. Calculation is straightforward.

Part 2
---
In second part first we need to implement tilts to other directions and then make a cycle. The amount of cycles is huge, so brute force
won't work. But we can see, that as the board is not very big, input is cyclic and amount of cycles is big. This probably means that there
will be a cycle after some tilts. We can check it. For this we "hash" the board to a string, create a set and start putting the new states
to it. After some time we indeed hit a cycle. Then we calculate the length of a cycle. And finally we calculate how many steps in the cycle
we'll be when the given amount of repetitions is done. And when it's done we are calculating the load.
