Part 1
---
Very straightforward problem. We just calculate the sequences and store them. Then we do the backward calculation. To save the memory we can
 store no the whole sequence, but just the last number.

Part 2
---
As straightforward as the first part. We just need to change one line of code to use the first value of the sequence in our calculations.
