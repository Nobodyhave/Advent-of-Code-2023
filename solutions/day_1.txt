Part 1

We split the input to lines, from each line create a string consisting of the first and last digit, convert it to integer and sum.

Part 2
---
Second problem is similar, the difference is how to find first and last digit. For the first digit we get the first digit itself, then we
look for all the first occurrences of the digits spelled by text and get the first of them. Then we take the first of these two. Same for
the last digit.
