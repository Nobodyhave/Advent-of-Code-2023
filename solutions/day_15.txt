Part 1
---
This part just need the implementation of hash function and the carrying out the calculations on the input.

Part 2
---
Not harder than the first part. Requires some data organisation. I've organised boxes in the Array (constant access by index and we know the
 size). Inside the box I use LinkedList for lenses. It has O(N) complexity for search, but O(1) for add and remove operations. It's also
 possible to use LinkedHashMap to get O(1) average for all the operations and keep the order, but the input is not very big, so not really
 necessary.
